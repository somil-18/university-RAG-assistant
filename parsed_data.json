You have all made it here through fierce competition and thus along with the welcome, I congratulate all of you for your achievement. It should be proud moment for you and your families.\n\nNow that you are here, you must think about how to 'extract' the maximum value out of your time here. Being a part of the post-graduate programme at CSE-IITB gives you several unique opportunities that you will probably never get after these 2-3 years. The campus and the facilities themselves are rarely found elsewhere - do go ahead and fully utilize those, while you are here. The demanding academics here will require you to have hobbies of sports and arts to keep your balance.\n\nIn terms of academics, not only will you get to hone your existing skills and learn advanced topics in Computer Science from some of the most accomplished teachers and researchers in the world, you get a unique opportunity to contribute to the knowledge space in your chosen area of interest through your Master\u2019s Thesis. Whether your interest lies in AI, Systems, or Theory, when you leave IIT Bombay, if you commit to the vision of the post-graduate program, the world will know a little bit more about some problem, because of some explorations you did; or the world will have a new product which you built here, or it will gain from some improvement on some technology that you did while here. I invite you to commit today to making such a contribution while here.\n\nYou also get to make a genuine and direct difference in students' learning, through your Teaching Assistantship. In these two years, while you are also a student, I hope you will find immense satisfaction in contributing to the learning of other students, who are junior to you and can benefit from your knowledge and experience. Similarly, through your Research Assistantships, I hope you find satisfaction in various practical technical contributions.\n\nLast but not the least, I hope you view being a part of any new organization as an opportunity to build new human relationships of all ages and levels - friends, staff, faculty; to learn from these, to broaden your views by engaging with people with diverse backgrounds, who you may thus far have never run into. I encourage you to take the opportunity to learn to communicate, to truly listen with an open mind, engage in civil discourses about difficult topics, and to look forward to changing at least one belief that you may currently have!\n\nYou are sure to get a lucrative job by the time you leave CSE IITB, but my wish is that when you leave with your post-graduate degree, you will look back to your time at CSE IITB and mark that as the\n",

The jobs we were offered paid more, the profiles we submitted were exciting, and we received some of the most desired international offers. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, we want to mention some of the unique features of placements@IITB. The placement process is managed by a student body and is overseen by a placement manager. We have a dedicated placement team that works tirelessly throughout the year to get everyone placed in the best company they can. The IITB placement team takes a lot of care to ensure that the salaries reported by the firms are accurate. We are one of the few institutes in India that require firms to disclose the gross salary component separately and verify it.\n\n# Statistics\n\nThe CSE department received several offers from both domestic and international universities. We have collected some of the best offers companies offer at the institute.\n\n| Average CTC                   | 27.25 LPA |\n| ----------------------------- | --------- |\n| Average Gross                 | 18.28 LPA |\n| Highest Domestic Package      | 45.84 LPA |\n| Highest International Package | 121K USD  |\n\nThe CTC represents the company's costs, including bonuses, stock, and other variable components. CTC is the figure often used to describe obesity in the media. This is the take-home pay before taxes.\n\nGross pay is the total amount of money an employee receives before taxes and deductions are taken out. This salary is a good indicator of what you'll earn monthly after you join. This component does not include stock options, one-time bonuses like joining bonuses, retention bonuses, etc.\n\nThis time many companies offered profiles that specifically targeted MTech CS graduates. Most students preferred a domestic job, and the number of profiles and the salaries offered was the best in the country (Gross).\n\nThe surprise this year was international offers. We managed to bag the most coveted US, Europe, Singapore, Taiwan, and Japanese offers in the institute from firms like Rubrik, Sony, Hitachi, and Uber.\n",

Taking due cognizance of the Institute\u2019s ideology of providing both students and employees with a sense of respect and dignity, the Cell leaves no stones unturned to ensure a safe and secure environment for them. The fundamental objective of the Cell encompasses that student continue learning without fear of prejudice, gender-bias, hostility, or harassment of any form. To establish that its beliefs are upheld, it takes the assistance of the internal complaints committee (GC-ICC). All complaints of sexual harassment are investigated by GC through ICC. The GC and ICC together endeavor to achieve an unbiased work environment where men and women thrive in their respective fields with equal opportunities being accorded to both.\n\nWebsite: www.gendercell.iitb.ac.in\n\nEmail: gendercell@iitb.ac.in\n\nContact: Prof. Rowena Robinson rowena@iitb.ac.in\n\n# SC/ST Cell\n\nThe SC/ST Students Cell addresses academic and non-academic issues and complaints received from students belonging to the SC and ST birth categories. The institute strives to maintain an environment where all communities can participate in academic and research activities without any sort of discrimination with respect to caste. To maintain such an atmosphere, the SC/ST students\u2019 cell is responsible for sensitizing the campus community about the importance of having diversity. The cell aims to ensure that anti-discrimination laws in the context of race/caste are followed in letter and in spirit. The institute is proud to implement reservation schemes as sanctioned by the constitution. The cell is currently convened by Prof. Bharat Adsul, Department of Computer Science and Engineering and co-convened by Prof. Madhu N. Belur, Department of Electrical Engineering.\n\nMain page link: https://www.iitb.ac.in/en/scst-students-cell\n\nFor complaining against any issue: https://goo.gl/forms/F3BKMxkdGu28OGRz2\n\n# Student Wellness Center\n\nDuring your journey through IIT Bombay, you may feel many parameters changing around you in your life. We all have faced that kind of problem during the initial phase of our new journey. Considering ongoing pandemic, you might find a bit difficult to adjust the new academic curriculum. Almost everyone in the Institute faces the same kind of academic and social pressure, which sometimes might lead to a bigger problem like anxiety, feelings of loneliness, low confidence, stress, anger, etc. If these problems are not attended correctly, and at the right time, it might lead to poor performance in academics and some.\n",

Students paying fees through the portal (online mode) must ensure that their transaction is completed in all respects.\n- Bank Loan/Sponsorship/NEFT: The Official Fee Demand for such students, to pay the fees directly to IT Bombay Bank Account, will have to be generated on ASC Portal only [\"Bank Loan/NEFT Fee payment\" tab at https://portal.iitb.ac.in/asc].\n- A demand will be valid for 10 days only, before which the money has to be transferred. In case of delays expected from the agency transferring the dates, a fresh demand has to be generated.\n- Once the money has been transferred, the student must enter the UTR number and other details on the ASC portal.\n- Initiate the payment process with the agency at least 15 days prior to the fee deadline as it takes a few days for reconciliation from the bank. Semester registration is linked to fee payment.\n- Students must not intimate IIT Bombay by email. Only online fee demand and UTR entry will be entertained henceforth.\n\nThe fee receipt will be generated after reconciliation, which may take 5-7 working days. Students need to collect the fee receipt in-person from the Cash Section at IIT Bombay for their records.\n\nDeputy Registrar (HCU)\n\n\n",

It is proposed that all PG courses should be available to UG students as electives. Any course from any other department can be taken as an elective subject to the approval of the faculty advisor.\n\n- CS 451 Distributed Systems\n- CS 407 Digital Signal Processing\n- CS 462 Analytical Models of Computing Systems\n- CS 467 Functional and Logic Programming\n- CS 449 Topics in Artificial Intelligence Programming\n- CS 336 Computer Aided Geometric Design\n- CS 475 Computer Graphics\n- CS 415 Numerical Computation\n- CS 444 Database Management Systems\n- CS 468 Computational Models in Pattern Recognition and Learning\n- CS 460 Natural Language Processing\n- CS 470 Modeling and Simulation\n- CS 346 Software Engineering\n- CS 352 Machine Learning\n- CS 406 Cryptography and Network Security\n- CS 414 Introduction to Wireless Networks\n- CS 329 Principles of Programming Languages\n- CS 435 Linear optimization\n- R &#x26; D Project I\n- R &#x26; D Project II\n\n# 3. Requirements of the Minor Programme\n\nAll CSE courses (including the DIC) are open to non-CSE students subject to pre-requisites being satisfied. If and when such students earn 30 credits through CSE courses, they will qualify for a minor in CSE. Since Data Structures is a pre-requisite for almost all CSE courses, the department will make two offerings of the course every year: A regular offering for CSE students in third semester and a separate offering for minor students. A small number of minor students may be allowed in the regular offering. CSE students who fail the course in regular offering will be allowed to clear the course by registering for the offering meant for minor students.\n\nA minor student can do up to one R&#x26;D project towards minor programme.\n\n\u2022 Intake of minor students will be restricted to 30 for the courses with combined offering for CSE and minors. With the increase in intake for OBC students, this number may be extended to 50.\n\n\u2022 The number of students who might be interested in CSE minor is likely to be very high. Restricting the number requires defining a clear non-subjective criterion for selecting students. The default criterion is overall CPI.\n\n\n",

However if there are time-table conflicts, a minor student may be exempted from the lab course provided the student performs the experiments necessary for understanding the theory course as may be advised by the instructor.\n\n# 4. Requirements for B.Tech. (Honours)\n\nA student should earn 30 additional credits over the minimum B.Tech. requirements to be eligible for the B.Tech. (Honours) degree. Of these, 12 credits have to be earned through elective CSE courses. The remaining 18 credits can be earned in any of the following ways:\n\n- CSE Elective courses.\n- A 6 credit B.Tech project I\n- A 12 credit B.Tech Project II.\n\n- B.Tech. Project II will be available to a student only if the student gets a minimum BB grade in B.Tech. Project I.\n\n- B.Tech. Project II must be a continuation of B.Tech. Project I under the supervision of the same faculty.\n\n# 5. Requirements of the DD Programme\n\nA dual degree student is required to earn the following additional credits beyond the requirements of the B.Tech. Degree:\n\n- 54 credits through CSE elective courses, of which 24 credits must be through graduate-level courses\n- A two-stage DD project of 72 credits\n\nIn the entire DD programme, a student can do at most 3 R &#x26; D projects as electives.\n",

The Institute is now recognized as a leader in science and engineering education worldwide. It has established a firm foundation for education and research with a vision to be the fountainhead of new ideas and innovations in technology and science. The mission of IIT Bombay is to create an ambiance in which new ideas, research and scholarship flourish and from which the leaders and innovators of tomorrow emerge.\n\nIIT Bombay on an average annually admits more than 1000 candidates for the undergraduate programmes (B.Tech./ Dual Degree and B.S.) through the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE), more than 30 candidates for B.Des. Programme through the Undergraduate Common Entrance Exam for Design (UCEED), around 300 candidates for the M.Sc. and the M.Sc. Ph.D. Dual Degree programmes, more than 1000 candidates for postgraduate programmes and around 300 candidates for Ph.D. programmes. IIT Bombay follows a credit-based semester system. There are two semesters in an academic year (Autumn: July- Nov; and Spring: January-April) during which all courses specified for various degree programmes are offered. There is one additional term during summer, called the Summer Term, for summer courses. Students are required to meet specified academic requirements each semester.\n\nThis booklet provides comprehensive information on the Rules and Regulations for B.Tech., Dual Degree, B.S. and B.Des. Programmes.\n\nIIT Bombay gives freedom to its various academic units to tailor their academic programmes as per their specific needs, within the frame work of the Rules and Regulations approved by the Senate from time to time. Keeping in view the new technical developments and to allow students some freedom to explore topics of their interest, IIT Bombay revised its Undergraduate Programmes curriculum (w.e.f. the Academic Year 2013). The revised curriculum provides additional opportunities and flexibility for students to optimize their learning experience. This needs continuous and meticulous planning of the academic profile on the part of each student to fully utilize the opportunities. The students, and parents/ guardians, are therefore, advised in their own interest to get fully familiar with the Academic system of the Institute. Student\u2019s attention is brought particularly to the assessment procedures and the specific rules governing the grading system, academic performance requirements etc.\n\nIIT Bombay offers its students best opportunities that are needed to create outstanding scientists and engineers. We hope that you will strive hard to utilize the resources available to fully develop your potential as an engineer/ scientist/ designer /economist/ social scientist.\n\nWe wish all our students a very bright future and a successful career.\n\nDean of Academic Programmes\n",

        "text": "\n# 1. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe B.Tech./ Dual Degree/ B.S. programmes consist of courses in basic sciences, humanities and social sciences, engineering and technology and other related topics. The sequence of studies broadly consists of three phases.\n\nThe first phase is an intense study of sciences, mathematics and humanities for deeper understanding of concepts than what was done in school.\n\nThe second phase is the study of engineering sciences and technical arts (such as workshop, engineering graphics, etc.). This study imparts broad based knowledge in general engineering, and engineering methodologies, and enables the students to appreciate the links between science and engineering. This phase is also, by and large, common across UG programmes, and overlaps with the first phase.\n\nIn the third phase, the students are exposed to subjects in their chosen areas of study, designed to train them in the methodologies of analysis of problems and synthesis of solutions. The courses cover the principles governing systems and processes, and develop the ability for physical and analytical modeling, design and development. They are also introduced to engineering practices through laboratory courses, projects, etc., and these vary from discipline to discipline.\n\nIn parallel with the third phase, students can strive to broaden their perspectives through at least two open Institute electives where they can take courses drawn from across the Institute.\n\nB.S. programme students, in addition, work independently on a project in their last two semesters.\n\nDual Degree students do additional courses to get in-depth knowledge in their chosen disciplines, often with specializations. In addition, they work on a research and development project during their final year.\n\nAt various stages of the programme, students are initiated into research methodologies, reading and interpreting research papers, use of engineering and scientific equipments/instruments, modern computational techniques, writing technical and scientific reports and effective communication.\n\nApart from the minimum credit requirements for the award of the degree, opportunities exist for supplementing the learning experience by crediting additional courses, in diverse areas. These additional credits, when they are in focused areas, can earn the students\u2019 credentials like Minor/ Honours.\n\nThe requirements for degree programmes run by the Institute are broadly classified as:\n\n- a) Institute Requirements (further divided into Compulsory courses, Elective courses and other requirements).\n- b) Departmental Requirements (further divided into Compulsory courses, Elective courses and other requirements).\n\nThe curriculum for various programmes are available on the Institute website: www.iitb.ac.in\n\n7\n\nMove to Index\n",

        "text": "\n# 1.1  Organizational Structure for Academic Administration\n\nThe academic programmes of the Institute are governed by Rules and Regulations approved by the Senate from time to time. The Senate is a statutory and supreme body that governs all academic matters of the Institute, and the rulings of Senate Chairperson (Director of The Institute) are final in regard to all academic issues. A definite time schedule is set by the Senate for various academic activities, through an Academic Calendar issued at the beginning of each academic year.\n\nThe Senate continuously assesses the academic programmes and makes appropriate revisions/modifications/improvements as and when required through two Institute level Senate sub-committees: The Undergraduate Programmes Committee (UGPC) for undergraduate programmes and a Post-Graduate Programmes Committee (PGPC) for post-graduate programmes. The Dean of Academic Programmes (Dean, AP) and the Associate Dean of Academic Programmes (Associate Dean, AP) are the Conveners &#x26; Co-conveners respectively of these committees.\n\nSimilarly, the performance and evaluation related issues are monitored by the Senate through two Institute level committees: Undergraduate Academic Performance Evaluation Committee (UGAPEC) and Postgraduate Academic Performance Evaluation Committee (PGAPEC). Conveners for these committees are designated from among Senate members. These four committees make recommendations to the Senate and in turn seek/receive opinions/recommendations, when required, from the two Department level committees in each department, the Department Undergraduate Committee (DUGC) and the Department Postgraduate Committee (DPGC). The DUGCs and DPGCs handle all academic matters, related to both academic programmes as well as performance of individual student. The Head of the Department is the convener of both these departmental committees. The Senate as well as its sub-committees also have student representatives. Administrative backup for all academic matters is provided by the Academic Office, with a Joint/Deputy Registrar (Academic) as in-charge.\n\nOn joining the Institute, each student is assigned a Faculty Adviser from his/her Department. Students must consult the Faculty Adviser on any matter relating to their academic performance and the courses they may take in various semesters/summer terms. The Faculty Adviser guides the students to complete their courses of study for the required degree in a timely manner, while maintaining good academic performance.\n\nAll academic issues connected with the B.Tech., Dual degree, B.S. and B.Des. programmes are handled by DUGC, UGAPEC and UGPC. If on any academic matter a student would like to approach this administrative structure, it is always through the DUGC with advice and recommendations from her/his Faculty Adviser.\n\n8\n\nMove to Index\n",

It is mandatory for students / faculty to strictly adhere to the academic calendar for completion of academic activities. The Academic Calendar can be seen on the Academic Office website of the Institute: (http://www.iitb.ac.in/newacadhome/toacadcalender.jsp)\n\n# 1.3 Conduct of classes for first year UG students (Ref. 256\u1d57\u02b0 Senate Meeting)\n\n- a) Lectures to be held ONLY between 8.30 am and 5.30 pm and only on working days.\n- b) No extra/compensatory lectures to be conducted on weekends in general. The lectures which are missed due to an Institute holiday, may be covered up on a weekend, preferably on Saturday.\n\n# 2 CURRICULUM / PROGRAMME OF STUDY\n\n# 2.1 Curriculum\n\nEvery Department has a prescribed course structure which, is known as the Curriculum. It prescribes the courses, labs and other requirements for award of the degree and sets out the nominal sequence semester-wise. It also gives the syllabus and a list of texts and reference books for each course. The Curriculum details are updated every semester and are made available at the Institute website.\n\n# 2.2 Semester \u2013 Autumn, Spring, Summer\n\nThe Institute follows a credit-based semester system. There are two regular semesters in a year. The semester that begins in July (July to Nov.) is known as the Autumn Semester or Semester 1 and the semester that begins in January (Jan. to April/May) is known as the Spring Semester or Semester 2. During the summer vacation, i.e., (May-June), a few courses are offered as part of Summer Term (refer Sec. 4.8). These courses can be taken by students as per summer term guidelines.\n\n9\n\nMove to Index\n",

        "text": "\n\n# 2.3 Course Credit Structure\n\nIn general, a certain quantum of academic work measured in terms of credits is laid down as the requirement for a particular degree. A student earns credits by satisfactorily clearing courses/ other academic activities every semester. The credits associated with a course/ other academic activity are dependent on the number of hours of work expected to be put in by the student per week.\n\n# 2.3.1 Theory and Laboratory Courses\n\nCourses are broadly classified as Theory Courses and Laboratory Courses. Theory courses consist of lecture (L) and tutorial (T) hours, but may have attached practical (P) hours in special cases. Laboratory courses consist of practical hours, but may have attached tutorial hours in special cases. Credit (C) for a course is obtained by multiplying the number of hours of instruction per week in that course, by two (2) for lecture and tutorial hours, and by one (1) for laboratory hours i.e. C = 2xL + 2xT + P. A student is expected to spend, on average, one hour every week outside class for every lecture/ tutorial held that week. Two examples of credit calculation are shown below:\n\n|   |   | Theory Courses |   | Laboratory Courses |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| - | - | -------------- | - | ------------------ | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |\n|   |   |                |   | L                  | T | P | C | L | T | P | C |\n| 2 | 1 | 0              | 6 | 0                  | 1 | 3 | 5 |   |   |   |   |\n\nIn the Courses of Study, if a theory course is shown as, say, CE304 Soil Mechanics II: 2 1 0 6, it means that CE304 is the course code, Soil Mechanics II is the course title and 2 1 0 6 corresponds to L T P C respectively.\n\nOther academic activities consist of a Seminar, Projects, which carry credits and NSO/ NSS/ NCC, in which only a pass (PP) or no-pass (NP) grades are awarded.\n\n# 2.3.2 Course Equivalence (Ref: 251\u02e2\u1d57 Senate Meeting):\n\nAddition of course equivalence for core courses will be permitted on approval of DUGC of respective Academic Units.\n\n# 2.3.3 Seminars\n\nSome departments prescribe a Seminar as a requirement for B.Tech./ B.S./ B.Des. or the Dual Degree. A Seminar is a course wherein under the guidance of a faculty member a student is expected to do an in-depth study in a specialized area by doing a survey of published technical literature and understand different aspects of the problem. Finally, the results from literature must be summarized in a written report and presented before a designated committee of faculty members. Seminars typically carry 3 credits.\n\n# 2.3.4 Projects\n\n# 2.3.4.1 B.Tech. Projects (BTP - I and BTP \u2013 II)\n\nSome departments prescribe Project as a requirement for the B.Tech. degree, or as a requirement for Honours (refer Sec.2.5.2), wherein under the guidance of a faculty member a student, in the\n\n\n",

The student is expected to do a survey of literature in the subject, work out a project plan and carry it out through design, analysis, experimentation etc. These projects (BTPs) may be offered as a single unit of 12 credits (BTP) or as 6 credits of BTP-I followed by BTP-II of 6 credits or 12 credits. (Ref: 241st Senate Meeting)\n\nEven when it is not prescribed as a minimum requirement for the degree or when not being interested in Honours, a student can opt to do a BTP as additional learning, if s/he can find suitable supervisor(s) to guide her/him.\n\n# 2.3.4.2 B.S. Project (Ref: 240th Senate Meeting)\n\nSome departments prescribe a B.S. Project as a requirement for the B.S. degree. Such a project is carried out under the guidelines of a faculty member and may carry 6 or more credits as prescribed by the department.\n\n# 2.3.4.3 Dual Degree Project (DDP)\n\nThe Dual Degree Project is a mandatory requirement of the Dual Degree Programmes. The project consists of two stages, spread over fourteen months, normally starting from the summer after the eighth semester and ending with the summer after the tenth semester. These are essentially research and development projects, where a student trains under the guidance of supervisor(s), in-depth analysis of an engineering problem and attempts synthesis of a solution. Literature survey, problem analysis and problem definition, extensive experimental/modeling/computational work and analysis of results typically form various components of the project work. A DDP (B.Tech.-M.Tech.) carries a total of 72 credits.\n\n# 2.3.4 Non-Credit Requirements\n\n# 2.3.4.1 NCC / NSO / NSS\n\nOne of the three activities, National Cadet Corps (NCC) or National Sports Organization (NSO) or National Service Scheme (NSS) is a mandatory requirement for all students for the award of a degree. These are normally conducted during evenings of week days and are designed to build character and to sensitize the students to social/national issues. These activities carry no credits and are evaluated as Pass (PP)/ Not Pass (NP).\n\n# 2.4 Minimum Credit Requirements and Planning of Individual Academic Programme (Ref: 233rd Senate Meeting)\n\nDepending on the discipline, the minimum credits required for the award of a B.Tech. / B.S. / B.Des. degree are between 266 and 282 (till 2021 batch), though the department component can be differently designed by the departments.\n\nThis is nominally divided into Basic Sciences (60 to 62), Engineering Sciences &#x26; skills (30), HSS Electives (12), Institute Electives (12), Departmental courses (152 to 168).\n\nThe \"B.Tech. + M.Tech.

Every student has specific abilities, interests and career goals.\n\nEach programme prescribes the minimum credits and courses that qualify a candidate for the award of the Degree in a particular discipline. The total credits for the B.Tech. Programme, for example, vary between 266-282 (till 2021 batch) depending on the discipline, as mentioned earlier. This approximately converts itself into about four theory courses and one or two laboratory courses or other activities like seminar, project, etc., every semester.\n\nThe curriculum is designed to permit B.Tech., B.S. and B.Des. students, who are not identified as academically weak, to optionally take additional courses. The freedom to take about six credits every semester after the first year, permits a student to satisfy her/his interests / abilities and aspirations.\n\nIt is expected that all students with reasonably good academic standing, utilize this surplus time for enhancing their academic learning experience, though the initiative is left entirely to them. They can use it to credit an assortment of courses/projects anywhere in the Institute, (subject to requirements of each of these courses being met), to gain a wide exposure. These additional academic accomplishments will find a separate mention in the transcript (refer Sec.6.8.4). They can also credit courses in specific areas which can qualify as a minor/ honours.

If 30 credits are not completed for Minor then Minor will not be awarded. The individual course credits earned, however, will be reflected in the transcript.\n\nFor the award of the minor, all requirements towards the basic degree and the minor have to be completed within the stipulated period of the programme one is registered for.\n\nThe Senate in its 224th meeting approved the proposal of allowing Dual Degree students to undertake minor courses. These rules were further modified in the 236th meeting of the Senate.\n\nDD students of category I and II can register for minor courses from 2nd year onwards.

The students are expected to consult the Faculty Adviser on any matter relating to their academic performance and the courses they may take in various semesters. The Faculty Adviser guides the students to complete their courses of study for the required degree.

Some courses may also require instructor consent.\n\n# 4.1 Semester-Wise registration\n\nOn joining the Institute, each student is assigned to a Faculty Adviser or an Advisory group (refer Sec.3). The student can register for courses s/he intends to take during a given semester or summer term on the basis of the programme for each discipline as given in the Curriculum and as per the advice given by his/her Faculty Adviser. The Faculty Adviser is expected to discuss with the student his/her academic performance during the previous semester and then decide the number and nature of the courses for which s/he can register during the semester within the framework of the guidelines as approved by the Senate. The Faculty Adviser may advise the student to drop one or more courses/ activities based on his/her academic performance (refer Sec. 5.1). In fact, the Faculty Adviser may even advise a reduced load programme over several semesters for students with poor performance at the end of the first semester/ year.\n\n# 4.2 Procedure for Registrations\n\nThe Institute has an online registration system and the registration is normally done on the first two days of each semester.

Moreover, a student cannot overstay in the programme once the minimum requirements prescribed for the basic degree are completed.\n\n# 4.9 Summer term Course Registration:\n\nRunning of courses in summer term and registration of students to these courses must follow the guidelines mentioned below:\n\n1. The course instructor/(s) should be willing to offer the course. The DUGC should recommend offering of such a summer course for consideration and approval of the Dean of Academic Programmes. The course is offered on approval of the Dean of Academic Programmes.\n2. The course should be offered with adequate rigor and in the same manner as a regular semester course is offered. The registration, examination and assessment, course duration and grading should adhere to the timelines in academic calendar. The total number of contact hours for the courses remains the same as that during the regular semesters, and therefore, the courses run at accelerated pace (for example 6 hours of instructions per week is expected for a 3-0-0 course) the Academic Calendar in this connection is strictly followed.\n3. The dropping of a Summer Course is permitted within 7 days from the first lecture of the course. Fee is not refundable.\n4. Re-exam is permitted on the same terms and conditions like that of regular semester courses.\n5. Time slots will be assigned by or communicated to the Academic Office like that of regular semester courses.\n6. A student can take up to a maximum of 24 credits of Mandatory Courses (Core + HSS + Department &#x26; Institute Electives) in which s/he has received FR/DX/DR/W grade. However, if a student accumulates two (or more) \u201cFR\u201d in Mandatory Courses and does not find enough courses (totaling up to 24 credits) in a summer term, s/he can take a maximum of two Mandatory Courses in which s/he has NEVER registered. (Ref: 239\u1d57\u02b0 Senate Meeting - effective from Summer term 2019-20).\n7. Courses requiring pre-requisites need instructor\u2019s approval in case the student has not completed the pre-requisites. (Ref: 239\u1d57\u02b0 Senate Meeting - effective from Summer term 2019-20).\n8. NO restrictions (i.e. #f) will apply after the expiry of the regular programme duration (4 years for B.Tech, B.Des. and B.S., 5 years for DD). (Ref:239\u1d57\u02b0 Senate Meeting - effective from Summer term 2019-20).\n9. At least 05 students should register for the summer course. The attendance record should be maintained and the minimum of 80% attendance is compulsory. The Instructors may award a \u201cFR\u201d grade to students who fail to adhere to 80% attendance for the summer course.\n\n\n",

These include institute core courses, department core and elective courses, non-departmental courses, minor and honours options. Registration for courses depend on the academic standing of the student, as explained in this section. The registration for backlog courses and audit courses are also explained in this section.\n\n# 5.1 Academic Standing (Ref: 236\u1d57\u02b0 Senate Meeting)\n\nDepending on the overall academic performance of a student till date, especially in the two preceding regular semesters (Autumn and Spring) in which the student had registered, the academic standing of the student is decided. A NP (not passed) grade is not counted towards failed courses in the context of determining the academic standing.\n\nCategorization of the academic standing of a student is as follows:\n\nCategory I: A student who has CPI at least 8, and no outstanding FR/DX/DR/W grade in a core course.\n\nCategory II: CPI less than 8, and no outstanding FR/DX/DR/W grade in a core course.\n\nCategory III (Ref: 241\u02e2\u1d57 Senate Meeting): A student who has at least one outstanding FR/DX/DR/W in core courses and at most one FR or DX grade in any other course in two preceding regular registered semesters, subject to having earned at least 18 credits in each of the semesters. These 18 credits may be earned in courses with any TAG.\n\nCategory IV (Ref: 241\u02e2\u1d57 Senate Meeting): A student who has at least one outstanding FR/DX/DR/W in core courses and more than one FR or DX grade in any other course in two preceding regular registered semesters, subject to having earned at least 18 credits in each of the semesters. These 18 credits may be earned in courses with any TAG.\n\nCategory V: A student who has not earned at least 18 credits (in courses with any TAG) in at least one of the previous two regular registered semesters.\n\nCategory VI (ARP): Students who have accumulated FRs/DXs worth 36 credits in core courses.\n\nNote:\n\n- a) Category VI supersedes all other categories.\n- b) Students in the 8\u1d57\u02b0 Semester for B.Tech./B.S. and 10\u1d57\u02b0 Semester for DD programmes may\n",

A course can be audited provided the course is offered in the semester as a credit course for others, and there is no slot clash. Prior permission of the Instructor is required.\n\nTo complete a course in 'Audit' mode, the student has to fulfil the requirement as set by the course instructor, such as submission of assignments and minimum performances in in-semester evaluations.

Relative weightage for in-semester evaluations is typically between 50 and 60 per cent. This will consist of one mid-semester exam of two hours duration, of about 25-30 per cent weightage, to be held as per the schedule fixed in the Academic Calendar. Two quizzes or one quiz and one test along with assignments and viva-voce shall make up the rest of the in-semester assessment or as declared by the course instructor at the beginning of the semester. The Instructor may also set aside up to a maximum of 20 per cent of the in-semester marks for attendance and/or class participation. (Ref: 235\u1d57\u02b0 Senate Meeting) Make-up for any absence from in-semester evaluations like midsem/tests/quizzes will be at the discretion of the Instructor.\n\nb)  The semester end examination will be held as per the Academic Calendar and the weightage for this would be typically 40 to 50 per cent. It is typically of 3 hours duration and covers the full syllabus of the course. The semester-end examination is mandatory. The instructor awards an \u201cII\u201d grade for those students not appearing for the Semester end examination, if they have not been awarded a DX grade for insufficient attendance. Such students are eligible for a semester-end re-examination only on medical grounds/ valid reasons (refer Sec. 6.6) and on production of medical certificate or other supporting documents as the case requires. The application must be submitted to Instructor concerned before the start date of re-exam and online grading window announced in the Academic Calendar. Instructors are expected to conduct the re-exam and upload the grade as per academic calendar.\n\nc)  If a student fails to appear for the re-examination too, the instructor will award \u201cFR\u201d grade again. If the absence in the re-exam is due to medical / valid reasons, the student must submit supporting documents as mentioned above, within seven days of the scheduled date of the re-exam, to the Academic Office. UGAPEC will examine such cases and convert the \u201cII\u201d grade into a dropped course status (\u201cDR\u201d). In all other cases the \u201cII\u201d grade will be converted to \u201cFR\u201d grade. In any case the \u201cII\u201d grade will not be continued beyond the commencement of the subsequent semester.\n\n# 6.2  Modes of Evaluation for Laboratory Courses\n\nThe assessment in a laboratory course will be based on turn-to-turn supervision of the student\u2019s work, her/his performance in viva-voce examinations and group discussions, the quality of their\n\n\n",

In-semester work will typically carry 75% and the semester-end test 25% weightage respectively. It is obligatory to maintain a laboratory journal as prescribed by the course instructor. The final examination for laboratory courses will typically be held a week before the final theory examinations. In case of absence from semester-end examination, the same rules as those for theory courses is applicable.\n\n# 6.3    Modes of Evaluation for Seminars\n\nSeminars are evaluated based on a written report and an oral presentation before a panel of exam-\n\niners appointed by the DUGC/ coordinator. The supervisor /co-supervisor, when involved, are part of the panel. Grades carrying grade points are awarded as in the case of theory and laboratory courses based on the quality of the report and performance in the presentation.

However, some depart-\n\nments may make it as the department requirement for the degree, and some might make it only as a component of the Honours requirement, whereas for Dual Degree, the project is a required com-\n\nponent for the award of degree. As the case may be, the separate modes of assessment are men-\n\ntioned hereunder.\n\n# 6.4.1  B.Tech. Project\n\nB.Tech. Project may be offered as one unit as BTP, or two independent units as BTP - I and BTP - II. Wherever it is split into two units, BTP - II builds on BTP - I, and BTP - I becomes a pre- requisite for BTP \u2013 II. Departments may prescribe a minimum performance in BTP - I (which may be higher than the pass grade \u2018DD\u2019) for being eligible for BTP - II. BTP - I and BTP - II are separately graded, at the end of the respective semesters.\n\nThese projects are supervised, and need regular interaction (at least once a week) with the super-\n\nvisor. Student has to submit a project report and defend it in front of a panel of examiners. The dates for submission of reports, the dates for presentations, and details of mode of assessment are decided by the individual departments.\n\n# 6.4.2  Dual Degree Projects\n\na)  The following is the schedule for the DDP assessments:\n\n1. For evaluation of DDP stage-I, the student has to submit a report to the respective de-\n2. partment. Evaluation will be done, by a panel appointed by the DUGC/ coordinator, based on the report and (a) either an across the table discussion and viva-voce or (b) seminar presentation. The panel shall consist of the supervisor(s) and at least one more faculty member, to act as examiners.\n3.

If the attendance of the student, as counted with effect from the first contact hour, falls below eighty percent of the total attendance expected, the instructor may award the student, \u2018Drop due to inadequate attendance\u2019, \u2018DX\u2019 grade in that course. This \u2018Drop due to inadequate attendance\u2019 Grade would, for the purpose of CPI calculation be treated as equivalent to a \u2018Course Drop\u2019 carried out on initiation by the student. In calculating attendance, no specific concession is to be given for lack of attendance on Medical ground. Further, if a student has 80% attendance or more, he/ she cannot be awarded \u2018Drop due to inadequate attendance. Only exception to this rule is courses where the instructor has declared a prior in the first week that no DX grade will be awarded.\n\ne) For a student present in the semester-end re-examination, the instructor will award a regular performance grade (AP-FR) depending on the overall performance in the course including the re-examination.\n\nf) There are, however, a few other academic requirements for the programmes. The following two grades viz., \u201cPP\u201d (Pass) and \u201cNP\u201d (Not pass), will be awarded for NCC/NSO/NSS. No grade points are associated with these grades and performance in these courses is not taken into account in the calculation of the performance indices (SPI, CPI). However, the award of the degree is subject to obtaining a \u201cPP\u201d (Pass) grade in all such courses. A student will be awarded \u201cPP\u201d (Pass) / \u201cNP\u201d (Not Pass) grade for NCC/ NSO/NSS in each semester provided the minimum requirement of these activities are met during that semester together with 80% minimum attendance, failing which the \u201cNP\u201d (Not Pass) grade will be awarded.\n\ng) (Ref: 239\u1d57\u02b0 Senate Meeting- effective from End Semester Examinations of the Spring Semester 2019-20).\n\n\u201cFF\u201d grade can be awarded to UG students by the concerned course instructor. The students will be given only one chance for re-examination in case of FF grade, otherwise the grade will be converted to FR. Re-exam will be conducted for 50 % weightage (or same as the weightage of end-semester exam for the course). Re-exam for students with FF grade will be conducted along with medical re-exam.\n\nThe grade will be restricted to \u201cDD\u201d for the re-examination, in case of FF Grade.\n\nh) Course(s) completed by student(s) outside IIT Bombay by means of NPTEL and / or SWAYAM and / or Semester Exchange, following due approval of DUGC/ DPGC, will contribute only towards completion of credits.

The SPI is the weighted average of the grade points obtained in all the courses registered by the student during the semester. For example, if a student passes five courses (Theory/labs. /Projects/ Seminar etc.) in a semester with credits C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5 and her/his grade points in these courses are g1, g2, g3, g4 and g5 respectively, then her/his SPI is equal to:\n\nC1g1 + C2 g2 + C3 g3 + C4 g4 + C5 g5\n\nSPI =\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nC1 + C2 + C3 + C4 + C5\n\nThe SPI is calculated to two decimal places. The SPI for any semester will take into consideration the FR grades awarded in that semester. For example, if a student has failed in course 4, the SPI will then be computed as:\n\nC1g1 + C2 g2 + C3 g3 + C4 * ZERO+C5 g5\n\nSPI =\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nC1 + C2 + C3 + C4 + C5\n\nThe courses which do not form the minimum requirement of the degrees will not be considered for calculation of the SPI.

The CPI therefore considers all the courses registered by the student, towards the minimum requirement of the degree s/he has enrolled for, since s/he entered the Institute. The CPI is calculated at the end of every semester to two decimal places.\n\nThe CPI will reflect the failed status in case of FR grade(s), till the course(s) is/are cleared.\n\nWhen the course(s) is/are cleared by obtaining a pass grade on subsequent registration(s) the CPI will only reflect the new grade and not the fail grades earned earlier.\n\nExample: Up to semester r a student has registered for n courses, among which s/he has a \u201cFR\u201d grade in course i.

The Undergraduate Research Awards (URA) is designed for such students. URA will be available at three levels, all of them independent of each other. They will carry codes similar to course codes so that they can be listed in grade reports.\n\n- URA01: for preliminary research/ developmental experience\n- URA02: for B. Tech. Level Research Project.\n- URA03: for Dual Degree Level Research Project\n\n# URA01\n\nThis is a recognition of a small research/ developmental effort, successfully completed by a student in the first, second or third year of an undergraduate programme \u2013 that is, a B.Tech., B.S. or a Dual Degree Programme. A faculty member must agree to supervise the student for the URA01 project. The student works with this faculty member, with the approval of the DUGC, for four-to-six month duration \u2013 including the summer or winter vacations. No formal registration is required with the academic office at this stage. If the faculty member is satisfied with the quantum and quality of work done, at any stage, s/he may recommend the award of URA01 to the student, which will then be listed in the transcript of the student in the semester immediately following the semester in which this award was recommended. No credits are assigned to URA01. URA01 can be awarded only once to a student. The grade for URA01 will be \u201cPP\u201d.\n\n# URA02\n\nThis is to be treated as recognition of truly exceptional work, both in quality and in extent, done in the B.Tech. Project. If the committee evaluating the B.Tech. Project of a B.Tech. student believes that the student has carried out truly exceptional work in the B.Tech. Project and the quantum of work is substantially higher than what is expected, it may recommend that two more faculty members, other than those who already participated in the committee for evaluation, duly chosen by the DUGC, examine the work done and evaluate whether a URA02 can be awarded to the student in addition to the AA grade already given. A joint recommendation must then be made by all: the original committee of evaluation and these two other faculty members that this student be awarded URA02, duly routed through the Convener, DUGC to the Convener, UGAPEC. This award, on approval by the UGAPEC, will be mentioned on the grade report of the student as URA02 carrying six credits and the grade AA. No formal registration is required with the academic office. The advantage to the student would be that his / her CPI would improve, given that these credits are with an AA grade. URA 2 is not available for DD students. Students should have earned minimum of 12 credits in BTP, in order to apply for URA 02 (Ref: 241\u02e2\u1d57 Senate Meeting)\n\nMove to Index\n",

ACADEMIC REHABILITATION PROGRAMME (ARP)\n\nThe Academic Rehabilitation Program (ARP) deals with students with poor performance in academics. It acts as a buffer for such students and provides them with an opportunity to continue in the institute and successfully complete their respective degrees. A student is transferred to ARP on receiving FR/DX grades for at least 36 credits in core courses. A faculty member in each department, called the ARP Faculty Adviser, will assist students of that department to register for courses manually, for a maximum of 24 credits.\n\nA student, who is able to reduce the total number of FR/DX credits to less than 36 as above is transferred back to being a regular student. On failure to exit the ARP after three consecutive semesters in the program, termination of registration from the program may be recommended.\n\n# 12. ALLOWING B.TECH. &#x26; B.S. STUDENTS TO LEAVE AFTER COMPLETING THEIR CREDIT REQUIREMENTS FOR B. TECH. &#x26; B.S. PROGRAMME EARLIER THAN 4 YEARS\n\nThe Senate in its 224\u1d57\u02b0 and 229\u1d57\u02b0 meeting approved the proposal of allowing B.Tech. &#x26; B.S. students to leave after completing their credit requirements for B.Tech. &#x26; B.S. Programme earlier than 4 years on the following terms and conditions:\n\n- a) B.Tech./B.S. students can apply for leaving the Institute at the end of an academic semester provided their credit requirements are met and they have spent at least three years in the institute.\n- b) The Convener, UGAPEC may approve the Credit Completion certificate, which can be given to the students, after clearance of all dues.\n- c) These students will be awarded their degree in the ensuing Annual Convocation as scheduled in Academic calendar.\n- d) The passing date would be the date UGAPEC approves the results, which will be the date to be mentioned on Transcripts.\n- e) The duration of programme would be still mentioned as 4 year B.Tech/ B.S. programme.\n\n\n",
